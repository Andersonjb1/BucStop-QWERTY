## BucStop-Goofin 
Playground SWE II 
### *IS FOR PRODUCTION*
BucStop-Goofin is a project worked on by the Cooked team, 
our team took __BucStop__ from another repo and made it our own.

We have made the project to be launched on AWS and containerized and hopefully un-containerized. 
#### We decoupled each game from the _WebApp_ including 
- [x]  Pong 
- [x]  Tetris
- [x]  Snake
 *Each game above has been decouple* 
###### After decoupling, we utilize *Serilog* to log microservices within the terminal.
