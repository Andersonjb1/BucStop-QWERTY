Vision: 
To learn about source control, deployment, and microservices through the management of the project with GitHub, the deployment of the project using a service like AWS, and the decoupling of features into their own containers and microservices.

MVP:
Significant change made to the code, non-noticeable change for the user.

Definition of Done:
Something is done once it has gone through at least two code reviews ensuring that it works and free of any volatile bugs that could cause it to break itself or the program as whole. The code reviews must have one real person review. It also must map back to a requirement in the product backlog. 

Calculated Target Velocity:
Each developer has 5  hours. Times that by 8 to get 40. Because no one is 100% productive, multiply that by 0.6 to get 24 hours. So the CTV is 24 hours.

Automation:
Discord notifications for whenever pull requests are made, within the Product Backlog Tool, and the docker file and AWS. Automated testing. AI Code Review on Github which will be researched on by Gavin. 

Product Backlog Tool/Sprint Board:
Jira

Prod, Test, Dev Environment:
VS Code or Visual Studio. At least have a Dev Environment and a Production Environment. 

Coding Standard:
Header Blocks at the top of every file stating information on the file such as sprint #, what was changed, date (when the pull request was made). Essentially a changelog. Short header above methods that explain what the method will do. 

Testing: 
Deployment testing, unit tests, there's so many testing methods guys just do it. Writing more individual test cases.
